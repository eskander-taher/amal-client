In 1955, in the city of Al Khobar, Sheikh Ahmed Mohammed Baghlaf - may God have mercy on him - established one of the first commercial institutions specialized in money transfer at the level of the Kingdom, Gulf Cooperation Council countries, and the Middle East. Thanks to God and then the distinguished management of Sheikh Jamal Ahmed Baghlaf, son of Sheikh Ahmed Mohammed Baghlaf - may God have mercy on him - who succeeded in establishing an independent holding group with diverse activities, thus moving to a new stage of expansion, steady growth, and excellence, both locally and internationally."
