## Design Consistency

The books feature maintains design consistency with existing features:

1. **Card Design**: Matches group cards and product cards

    - Same rounded corners with shadow effects
    - Same "More" button style and animation
    - Same title tab positioning (bottom-right)
    - Same hover scale animation

2. **Hero Section**: Consistent with news and products pages

    - Same structure and styling
    - Same typography

3. **Filters**: Similar to products page

    - Same button style
    - Same color scheme (yellow for active, gray for inactive)
    - Same hover effects

4. **Color Scheme**:

    - Primary: Yellow (#FCD34D - yellow-500)
    - Background: White and light gray (#f5f5f7)
    - Text: Gray scale for hierarchy

5. **Icons**: Using Lucide React icons (consistent with admin panel)

6. **Typography**: Consistent with site-wide typography

## Responsive Design

-   **Mobile (< 640px)**: 1 column grid, stacked filters
-   **Tablet (640px - 1024px)**: 2 column grid

## Performance Considerations

1. **Image Optimization**: Using Next.js Image component for automatic optimization

2. **Pagination**: Add pagination for large book collections
3. **Advanced Filters**: Add filters for language, publish year, etc.
4. **Sorting**: Add sorting options (newest, popular, alphabetical)
